# Apparel Product Recommendation in E-commerce

This project aims to provide recommendations for similar apparel products in e-commerce using both text and image-based approaches. By analyzing product titles and images, we can suggest relevant and similar items to enhance the user experience and drive customer engagement.

<h1>Overview</h1>
In the world of e-commerce, providing personalized recommendations is crucial for improving customer satisfaction and driving sales. This project focuses on recommending similar apparel products to users based on their interests and preferences. We leverage both text and image-based techniques to offer a comprehensive recommendation system.

<h1>Text-Based Recommendation</h1>
To enable text-based recommendations, we employ several techniques such as Bag-of-Words (BOW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and IDF Weighted Word2Vec. These methods analyze the textual data, particularly the product titles, to capture the essence of the products and find similarities.

BOW is a simple and effective technique that represents the products based on the frequency of words in their titles. TF-IDF takes into account the importance of words by considering their occurrence frequency across the entire dataset. IDF Weighted Word2Vec combines Word2Vec embeddings with IDF weights to capture the semantic meaning of words while also considering their importance in the dataset.

By utilizing these text-based methods, we can generate recommendations for similar apparel products based on their titles. These recommendations aim to match users' preferences and provide them with relevant options to explore.

<h1>Image-Based Recommendation</h1>

In addition to text-based approaches, we incorporate image analysis to enhance the recommendation system. Images play a significant role in the e-commerce industry, and visual similarity can greatly influence users' purchase decisions.

For image-based recommendations, we utilize the VGG-16 model, a powerful deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. By extracting features from the images using VGG-16, we can represent apparel products in a high-dimensional space.

To find similar images, we employ techniques such as TF-IDF Weighted Word2Vec and IDF Weighted Word2Vec. These methods combine the image features with the textual information, creating a unified representation that captures both visual and semantic similarities.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
This project successfully develops a recommendation system for similar apparel products in e-commerce, employing both text and image-based approaches. By leveraging techniques such as BOW, TF-IDF, IDF Weighted Word2Vec, and VGG-16, we can provide users with personalized recommendations based on product titles and visual features.

The text-based methods offer insights into the semantic similarity of products, while the image-based approach enhances the recommendations with visual appeal. By combining these techniques, we can create a more comprehensive and accurate recommendation system that enhances the overall user experience.

Moving forward, this recommendation system can be deployed on e-commerce platforms to help users discover new apparel products that align with their preferences and increase customer engagement.
